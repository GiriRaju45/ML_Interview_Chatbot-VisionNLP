## Project: Machine Learning Theoretical Interview Chatbot

### Overview

This project focuses on building a chatbot for conducting machine learning theory-based interviews. Two models were implemented: a custom Encoder-Decoder RNN and a GPT-2-based model. Both models were trained on a dataset created by web scraping machine learning-related websites and blogs.

### Models

1. **Custom Encoder-Decoder RNN Model:**
   - Developed from scratch
   - Understands and generates text responses
   - Trained on the machine learning theory dataset

2. **GPT-2-Based Model:**
   - Utilizes pre-trained GPT-2 architecture
   - Leverages powerful text generation capabilities
   - Trained on the machine learning theory dataset

### Dataset Creation

#### Web Scraping Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered machine learning theory-related questions and answers from reputable online sources, including websites, blogs, and forums.

2. **Source Selection**: Carefully selected websites and platforms known for quality machine learning content.

3. **Web Scraping**: Automated data extraction using Python libraries like Beautiful Soup and Scrapy. Custom scripts visited selected websites, extracted relevant text content, and saved it for dataset creation.

**Training the Models:**
   - Fine-tune the GPT-2 model using the dataset.
   - Train the custom Encoder-Decoder RNN model.

### Conclusion

The Machine Learning Theoretical Interview Chatbot project simplifies candidate screening for machine learning roles. The custom and GPT-2 models offer efficient solutions for evaluating candidates' theoretical knowledge in the field.
